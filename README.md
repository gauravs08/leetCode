Problem 3: [LongestSubstringLength](src/java/LongestSubstringLength.java)

‘Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.’ Given a string, the task is to find the length of the longest substring in the string that does not contain any repeating characters. This problem is often used as a basis for other more complex problems and has applications in a wide range of fields, including natural language processing, bioinformatics, and machine learning.

Problem:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"

Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
